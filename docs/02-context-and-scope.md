# 2. Context and Scope

## 2.1 Business Context

### 2.1.1 Project Background
This is a **technical assignment application** developed to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities with Next.js 16. The project serves as a practical implementation of secure authentication systems, CRUD operations, and modern deployment practices for educational assessment purposes.

### 2.1.2 Educational Value
As a House of EdTech assignment submission, this project showcases:
- Implementation of secure authentication flows (JWT-based)
- Full-stack development with TypeScript and modern tooling
- Production deployment with CI/CD to multiple platforms
- Security measures against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Clean, maintainable code following best practices

### 2.1.3 Primary Stakeholders
